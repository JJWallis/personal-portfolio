I had mobile and desktop designs to work to and built it so that it\nwas fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach and used modern CSS\nlike Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes. Interaction Design / Front End\nDevelopment HTML / CSS Visit Website Project Background This project was a\nfront-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that enables you\nto practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each\nchallenge includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website\nshould look at different screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped\nme refine my workflow and solve real-world coding problems. I’ve learned\nsomething new with each project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.\nStatic Previews Insure Previous Project Manage Next Project Interested in\ndoing a project together?
