I built a fully-responsive landing page. The\nonly JavaScript this project required was to enable the toggling of the\nmobile navigation. Interaction Design / Front End Development HTML / CSS /\nJS Visit Website Project Background This project was a front-end challenge\nfrom Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that enables you to practice\nbuilding websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge includes\nmobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at\ndifferent screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my\nworkflow and solve real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new\nwith each project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.
