## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  Mobile-first workflow
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Sass
-  Typescript

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
   color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
   console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

###### TODO

HTML:

CSS:

Diff colour shades Sass map |

JS:

SVG animation - outline drawing | bounce effect | descendant class for button:hover to animate SVG | <g> | hmarbuegr animation - rotating both top line + middle ones fades out (opacity) - classic animation used for it to change into close cross icon

Design basics - design note

---

Linked list - multiple types (singular, doubly linked, circular linked + can be both double + circular at same time) | similar to arr as list of items - but instead of index values each item points to the next (doubly - points to next + previous item) | thats how you traverse it + know where you are | great for certian actions - inserting data is good (between two points + change their positions) but grabbing individual data is longer (vs specific index)

Binary tree - root node at top + every single node in tree can only have two children max | L + R directions/properties of each node pointing to child nodes (forms tree + contains childrens value) - how you traverse it | reversing/inverting + sorting -

Stack + Queue - very similar to one another | Stacks - like a stack of books (most recently read/taken book goes on top/taken from the top of pile - at end of stack) | LIFO - last in first out (push() + pop()) | Queues - like a queue in real life (opposite) - first out is front of line + when join go to back of queue- FIFO (first in first out) | methods - dequeue() for first out + take off front of queue (pop()) + enqueue() for first in + adding to back

Merge Sort algo - type of divide + conquer algo | large issue of sorting an array + divide into ever increasingly smaller subsets until bunch of small subsets of original values remain (middle line in img) | you then start conquering those subsets by combining them together over + over again until resulting in sorted arr | Quick Sort algo - few differences with performance (merge is quicker but requires more space - weigh both space + time complexity for importance)

Dictionary/Map/Hash Table = taking a key + converting to a value in some storage method | JS - could use an obj or map to show this | key mapping to a value - what we've doing this whole time
