## Overview

### The challenge

Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-  Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
-  Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
-  The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
-  The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
