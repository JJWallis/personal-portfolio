HTML:

CSS:

Diff colour shades Sass map |

JS:

SVG animation - outline drawing | bounce effect | descendant class for button:hover to animate SVG | <g> | hmarbuegr animation - rotating both top line + middle ones fades out (opacity) - classic animation used for it to change into close cross icon

Design basics - design note

---

Linked list - multiple types (singular, doubly linked, circular linked + can be both double + circular at same time) | similar to arr as list of items - but instead of index values each item points to the next (doubly - points to next + previous item) | thats how you traverse it + know where you are | great for certian actions - inserting data is good (between two points + change their positions) but grabbing individual data is longer (vs specific index)

Binary tree - root node at top + every single node in tree can only have two children max | L + R directions/properties of each node pointing to child nodes (forms tree + contains childrens value) - how you traverse it | reversing/inverting + sorting -

Stack + Queue - very similar to one another | Stacks - like a stack of books (most recently read/taken book goes on top/taken from the top of pile - at end of stack) | LIFO - last in first out | Queues - like a queue in real life,
